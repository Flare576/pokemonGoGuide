#What Is Pokémon Go
</a>

Pokémon Go is a type of game called "Augmented reality," which simply means it takes an aspect of reality and adds something to it. In the case of Pokémon Go, it uses a real map and your actual latitude/longitude and then adds points of interests (called PokéStops and Gyms) as well as Pokémon. If you're unfamiliar with Pokémon as a whole, be sure to read the section [What Are Pokémon](#what_are_pokemon). The game is available on Android and iOS.

>NOTE: It is recommended you don't login for your first time in a moving vehicle. As part of the proces you will be choosing your first Pokémon, but they will not follow you if you move.

When you launch the game, you'll be asked to login, either via your Google account or by creating a new Trainer Account. After logging in, you'll be allowed to configure your avatar (what you'll look like in the game) and then be dropped onto a map. You'll likely see a lot of things pop up around you, but the most important will be three Pokémon: Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle. You'll be able to tap on one and [Catch it](#catching_pokemon)

After that, you'll have a chance to look around. You'll probably see some [Pokéstops](#what_is_a_pokestop),

#Pokéstops
</a>

Pokéstops, which from a distance look like cubes atop pedestals, represent points of interest in the real world. These could be art fixtures, historic buildings, signs, or other landmarks. When you get close to them, they will expand into concentric circles resembling a Pokéball.

When you are close enough to a Pokéstop for it to transform, you're close enough to interact with it. Simply tap the icon and it will zoom into a detailed look at the location.

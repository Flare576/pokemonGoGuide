#What Is Pokémon Go
Pokémon Go is a type of game called "Augmented reality," which simply means it takes something from reality and adds something to it. In the case of Pokémon Go, it uses a real map and your actual latitude/longitude and then adds points of interests (called PokéStops and Gyms) as well as Pokémon. If you're unfamiliar with Pokémon as a whole, be sure to read the section [What Are Pokémon](#what_are_pokemon)
